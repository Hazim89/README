Assigment 1: Report

Reflection

In this assignment, we evaluated several Malaysian government websites using Google Lighthouse, focusing on performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. We found that while some websites excelled in certain areas, like the Ministry of Finance Malaysia (MOF) with good overall performance, many had significant shortcomings, particularly in accessibility and performance. One key improvement needed is for the Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) to enhance its website's accessibility and performance to ensure a better user experience. My contribution to this assignment included analyzing the websites, interpreting the Google Lighthouse metrics, and suggesting actionable improvements for each site.
